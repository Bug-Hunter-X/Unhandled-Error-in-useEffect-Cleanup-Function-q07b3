This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a cleanup function that throws an error.  The error might be subtle and not immediately obvious, especially when it's related to asynchronous operations. For example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('some_url');
      if (!isMounted) return; //Check if component is unmounted 
      const data = await response.json();
      setData(data);
    } catch (error) {
      // Error handling is crucial here, but may be insufficient to prevent the bug
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    }
  };

  fetchData();

  return () => {
    isMounted = false; // Cleanup function
    // Additional cleanup logic that might throw an error
    console.log('cleanup');
    //If some error happens here, it might be a reason for this bug
  };
}, []);
```

The cleanup function might throw an error if it tries to access a resource that no longer exists or performs an action that's invalid after the component is unmounted.  React Native doesn't always provide a clear error message in this scenario. The application might crash or show unexpected behavior.
