The solution involves robust error handling within the cleanup function and ensuring all asynchronous operations are properly cancelled or handled during unmounting. This often involves using a flag to indicate whether the component is still mounted and ignoring cleanup operations if it's not. 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  let isMounted = true;
  const fetchData = async () => {
    try {
      const response = await fetch('some_url');
      if (!isMounted) return;
      const data = await response.json();
      if (isMounted) setData(data); //Set data only if mounted
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
      //Consider adding a state variable to display error to the user
    }
  };

  fetchData();

  return () => {
    isMounted = false; 
    try{
      //Attempt cleanup operations that might throw an error
      console.log('cleanup');
    } catch(e) {
        console.error('Error during cleanup:', e);
    }
  };
}, []);
```

By adding a `try...catch` block around potential error sources in the cleanup function, we prevent the unhandled error from crashing the application.  The error is now logged, allowing for better debugging and improved application stability.
